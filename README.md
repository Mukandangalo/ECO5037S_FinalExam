**ECO5037S Final Exam - Fintech and Cryptocurrencies**
This repository contains solutions for the practical coding questions in the ECO5037S Final Exam for the Fintech and Cryptocurrencies course at the University of Cape Town. The code is implemented in Python using the Algorand SDK, covering applications on the Algorand blockchain, including a decentralized Stokvel and a Liquidity Pool for a decentralized exchange (DEX).

**Project Description**
The code in this repository is divided into two main applications:

Stokvel Application: A decentralized finance (DeFi) platform for a rotating savings and credit association among five participants, utilizing multisignature (multisig) accounts on the Algorand blockchain.

Liquidity Pool and Decentralized Exchange: A simulation of a DEX and liquidity pool that enables trading between Algorand's ALGO cryptocurrency and a South African Rand stablecoin, UCTZAR. This application demonstrates liquidity provisioning, trading, and rewards distribution.

**File Descriptions**
stokvel_algorand.py: Code for the Stokvel application, which manages funds using a multisig account for collective savings and payout distribution.
liquiditypool_defi.py: Code for the DEX simulation, which manages liquidity pools, trading pairs, and fees distribution.
